  <h1>Design Insights</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    Beyond individual gestures and physics, great interaction design requires understanding
    higher-level principles: spatial consistency, when to animate and when not to,
    how to make gestures discoverable, and how to make touch interfaces accessible to everyone.
  </p>

  <div class="section-sep">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</div>

  <!-- ════ Spatial Consistency ════ -->
  <h2 id="sec-spatial">Spatial consistency</h2>
  <p>
    Motion should communicate <strong>where things come from and where they go</strong>.
    When you swipe up to dismiss an app on iOS, the app shrinks back toward its icon in the
    dock. When you tap a notification, the content expands from the banner. This spatial
    relationship creates a mental model of where things &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    The principle: <strong>motion is information</strong>. An element sliding in from the right
    tells you it came from the right. A sheet sliding up tells you it's a layer on top. When
    the same element always arrives from the same direction, users build spatial memory that
    makes navigation feel effortless.
  </p>

  <div class="section-sep">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</div>

  <!-- ════ Frequency & Novelty ════ -->
  <h2 id="sec-frequency">Frequency &amp; novelty</h2>
  <p>
    As a designer, the instinct is to animate everything. Object permanence, creating a focal
    point, and delight are all good reasons. But it's less obvious <strong>when not to animate</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The principle: <strong>animation frequency and novelty are inversely related</strong>.
    High-frequency interactions (command menus, tab switching, typing) should be instantaneous.
    Low-frequency interactions (first-time onboarding, completing a purchase, achievement
    unlocks) deserve a flourish. Context menus on macOS appear without animation &mdash;
    used thousands of times a day, with very low novelty.
  </p>

  <div class="section-sep">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</div>

  <!-- ════ Touch Visibility ════ -->
  <h2 id="sec-visibility">Touch content visibility</h2>
  <p>
    On touch interfaces, your finger can obfuscate what's happening underneath it. This is
    a fundamental challenge that desktop interfaces don't face &mdash; a mouse cursor is a
    tiny arrow, but a thumb covers a large area of the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well-designed interfaces account for this. When you press and drag to move the text caret
    on touch interfaces, temporary magnification or an offset preview can keep the target
    visible while your finger is still covering the original position.
  </p>
  <p>
    For sliders and scrubbers: the dragging gesture should not cancel when the finger moves
    away from the track. Once the user has grabbed the handle, they should be able to move
    their finger freely while still controlling the value. This is what pointer capture solves &mdash;
    but the design insight is that <strong>commitment to an interaction should outlast
    physical proximity to its target</strong>. The rubber band slider in
    <a href="/patterns/#sec-rubber-slider">Chapter 3</a> demonstrates this: dragging past
    the track&rsquo;s bounds deforms the control itself, communicating the boundary through
    shape rather than just stopping the value.
  </p>

  <div class="section-sep">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</div>

  <!-- ════ Discoverability ════ -->
  <h2 id="sec-discoverability">Discoverability</h2>
  <p>
    Hidden gestures are a usability problem. If a user doesn't know a gesture exists, it
    effectively doesn't exist for them. The best touch interfaces teach gestures through
    <strong>progressive disclosure</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul class="note-list">
    <li><strong>Visual affordances</strong> &mdash; a slight peek of content at the edge hints that swiping reveals more. A handle bar on a sheet suggests it can be dragged.</li>
    <li><strong>Consistent metaphors</strong> &mdash; once you learn that swiping up dismisses one thing, you can predict it works on similar things. Reuse reduces the learning burden.</li>
    <li><strong>Fallback paths</strong> &mdash; every gesture should have a visible alternative. A swipe-to-delete row should also have a delete button in the detail view. Not everyone discovers gestures; not everyone can perform them.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="section-sep">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</div>

  <!-- ════ Accessibility ════ -->
  <h2 id="sec-a11y">Accessibility</h2>
  <p>
    Touch gestures are inherently visual and spatial &mdash; they require seeing the target,
    reaching it, and performing a coordinated movement. Not all users can do this.
    Accessible gesture design means providing <strong>equivalent alternatives</strong>
    for everyone.
  </p>

  <h3>Reduced motion</h3>
  <p>
    Users who experience vestibular disorders or motion sickness can enable a system preference
    that requests reduced animation. When this is active, spring animations should snap instantly
    to their destination. The interaction still works &mdash; everything arrives where it should &mdash;
    it just skips the journey.
  </p>

  <h3>Alternative Paths (Mobile-first)</h3>
  <p>
    If your product is primarily mobile and gesture-driven, you don't need a keyboard mapping
    table for every interaction. What still matters is visible fallback paths for critical
    actions (delete, close, confirm, undo), so no task is gesture-only.
  </p>

  <h3>Touch target sizes</h3>
  <p>
    The minimum recommended touch target is <strong>44 &times; 44 pixels</strong> (Apple)
    or <strong>48 &times; 48dp</strong> (Material Design). Even if the visual element is
    smaller, the hit area should meet the minimum. Smaller targets increase error rates for
    everyone, especially users with motor impairments.
  </p>

    <p><strong>Accessibility checklist for gesture interfaces:</strong></p>
    <ul class="note-list" style="margin-bottom:0;">
      <li>Critical gesture actions have visible button alternatives</li>
      <li>Animations respect the user's reduced-motion preference</li>
      <li>State changes are announced to screen readers</li>
      <li>Touch targets are at least 44 &times; 44px</li>
      <li>Swipe actions have visible alternative buttons</li>
      <li>Color is not the only way to communicate state</li>
